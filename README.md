# `debuggable`: utilities for making your applications more debuggable.

This package provides various utilities that can be used to make your
application easier to debug. Some of these tools are intended for use during
actual debugging only (similar to `Debug.Trace`, for example). Other tools can
be used as a regular component in your application, to facilitate debugging if
and when necessary, but always present in your code.
